#FeliAM
for CIS7 Final

This program asks the user to input a text-string, a cipher key, and to choose between encryption and decryption. Once inputs are given and an option is selected, the program extends the inputted key to a length that covers the entire text-string and subsequently either encrypts or decrypts the text-string according to the Vigenere Cipher. After finishing, the program displays the resulting text-string to the user.

The project was done using a mix of Declarative, Procedural, and Functional programming approaches. The author of this program is Feli Agnes Mayanja, and it was published December 8th 2024.

To use the program, just input a phrase, key, and a number between 1 and 2. As a note, this program was originally written in onecompiler, so debugging was done without an interactive console. You can input the program’s code in onlinegdb.com if you’d like to experience it that way.
